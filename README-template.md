## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

The process of building the project was quite fast, with the aid of the features from styled components, it was pretty easy to implement the different themes of the app. Although, I had a bit of hassle implementing a user being able to use the border of a country to the page of the "border country". I later just implemented a loop and got the country.

### Built with

- ReactJS
- Vite
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Styled-Components
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Well, I learnt how to add a theme switcher for the application easily.

### Continued development

I am currently learning React Native and I plan on building the same project using React Native as well as for other challenges that I will be participation on, on the platform.
I will also probably tweak the animation, if I do get better at using framer motion.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.framer.com) - The documentation helped me in implementing the little animations and hover active states that are on the page
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - The documentation helped is using the library better, such as passing props which was later used to style the element based on certain states.
